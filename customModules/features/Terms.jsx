            Fidio provides a marketplace for Afro-inspired artists, venues,
            festivals, and merchants (collectively, “Event Producers”) to offer
            live-streamed and pre-recorded entertainment events (“Events”) and
            to sell tickets (“Tickets”) to those Events to consumers
            (“Attendees”, collectively with Event Producers and other Site
            visitors, “Users”). In this regard, Fidio acts as an intermediary
            between Event Producers and Attendees and not an agent or broker of
            Event Producers. We do not guarantee any number of Tickets that will
            be available to purchase for an Event, the quality of the experience
            provided by an Event Producer, or the conduct of any User. We may
            make changes to the Services at any time, without notice. If you
            object to the changes, your sole recourse is to stop using the Site.
            Certain features of the Site may be subject to additional terms.

          <p style={paraStyle} class='mt-2 font-sans text-sm font-light'>
            It is your duty as an Event Producer to accurately describe the
            experience in connection with any Tickets you offer and, by offering
            a Ticket, you agree that you will provide the experience described.
            If you fail to provide such experience, you agree to indemnify us
            and reimburse us for any refunds that we need to issue and damages
            that we suffer due to your failure. If your Event is postponed or
            rescheduled, you agree to provide the experience described in the
            Ticket at such reasonable later date. In the event that you do not
            provide the experience, we will not remit any payments to you unless
            and until we are satisfied (in our discretion) that Attendees will
            be issued replacement Tickets or refunds. Unless you have a separate
            agreement with us, you acknowledge and agree that all of your Events
            will be accessible to Attendees who purchase an individual Ticket or
            a subscription. You must also furnish a working contact and support
            email address which will be displayed on your Fidio store.

            You are responsible for creating the images, words, graphics,

            Producer page, communicated to your Attendees through Event Producer
            Communications (defined below), and performed and displayed as part
            of an Event (collectively, the “Event Producer Content”). You are
            solely responsible for securing all third-party permissions,
            licenses and approvals that may be required (e.g., from record
            labels, music publishers, managers, agents, etc.) for all Event
            Producer Content you make available on the Site, including without
            limitation to perform, display, record and replay a streaming Event,
            where applicable. You warrant and represent that, prior to providing
            any Event Producer Content to the Site, you have all of the
            foregoing permissions, licenses and approvals, and shall indemnify,
            defend and hold Fidio and its affiliates harmless from all claims in

            Communications”), including honoring any and all marketing opt-out

            Producer, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless for
            any liability or loss incurred by us as a result of the Event
            Producer Content or Event Producer Communications. As an Attendee,

            not transfer or sell access to your account or use another User’s
            account without that User’s permission. You will be responsible for

            or password. You will immediately notify us in writing if you
            discover any unauthorized use of your account or other
            account-related security breach. We may require you to change your

            someone else’s rights. You will have no ownership in your account or

            An Event Producer may establish and manage its own account or
            delegate permission to authorized individuals to do so on its
            behalf, resulting in multiple User accounts associated with one
            Event Producer account. In such case, Event Producer and each
            authorized User are responsible for compliance with the obligations
            of Event Producer hereunder in these Terms and our Privacy Policy
            and the term “Event Producer” shall mean both the individual Event
            Producer and all authorized Users associated with its account. A
            particular User (such as a business manager, public relations
            manager, or social media manager) may be associated with more than
            one Event Producer account, in which case that User is responsible
            for compliance with the obligations of each Event Producer the User
            represents.

            merchandise that an Event Producer might include as part of an
            order. While we may collect information from Attendees with respect
            to merchandise (such as shipping and size information), the Event
            Producer is solely responsible for fulfilment of the merchandise
            orders and Fidio has no responsibility for the accuracy of any

            offer special promotional offers (“Offers”) to Attendees. Offer
            eligibility is determined by us in our sole discretion, and we

            All prices are charged in U.S. Dollars (unless otherwise stated).
            Applicable taxes shall be separately assessed as required by law at
            the time of checkout. If applicable, currency exchange rates and
            foreign transaction fees are generally determined and applied by
            your payment provider, and you acknowledge and agree that we have no
            responsibility for refunding or compensating you for amounts or
            expenses incurred in connection with those fees. If the amount you
            pay for a Ticket is incorrect (regardless of whether it is incorrect
            because of an error in a price posted on the Site or otherwise
            communicated to you), if you are able to order a Ticket before its
            scheduled on-sale or presale date, or if you are able to order a
            Ticket that was not supposed to have been released for sale, then we
            will have the right to cancel that Ticket (or the order for that
            Ticket) and refund to you the amount that you paid. This will apply
            regardless of whether the error occurred because of human error or a
            transactional malfunction of the Site. If a refund is processed in
            error, or a refund exceeds the original amount paid, we reserve the
            right to recharge the original method of payment used at the time of
            purchase. Shipping and handling fees and taxes charged or collected
            by us for merchandise made available for purchase by an Event
            Producer will be added to your order and will appear as a separate

            original method of payment used at time of purchase (as outlined
            below) unless your Ticket was part of a subscription, in which case

            discretion, we may issue you a refund for a non-subscription Ticket
            due to a canceled Event and, in such event, we will issue a refund
            of the Ticket face value paid. If a refund is issued, it will be
            processed to the original method of payment used at time of
            purchase. We cannot issue a refund to a different credit or debit
            card. If your credit card or debit card number has changed, but is
            for the same account (e.g., a new card has been issued for the same
            account), the refund will be processed to that account. You agree
            that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any refund
            prohibitions in any manner with regard to the Ticket you purchased.
            Without limiting the foregoing, you will not contact us to seek a
            refund or exchange from us when we are prohibited from providing one
            by the Event Producer, and you will not dispute or otherwise seek a
            “chargeback” from the company whose credit card you used to purchase
            the Ticket from the Site. Should you do so, your Tickets or
            subscription may be canceled, and we may, in our sole discretion,
            refuse to honor pending and future Ticket and subscription purchases
            made from all credit card accounts or online accounts on which such
            chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit all persons in whose
            name the credit card accounts exist and any person who accesses any
            associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches

            Individual Tickets are sold on a first come first served basis and

            The ability to view a streaming Event may be limited depending on

            responsible for determining whether your Internet speed, device, and
            browser can support a streaming Event and Fidio strongly suggests
            that you test your Internet speed, device, and browser before making
            a streaming ticket purchase. Fidio is not liable for troubleshooting
            issues, Internet loading, or capacity issues if these cause
            Attendees to miss any part of an Event. Fidio does not assist with
            the production of the Event or any other part of the Event,
            including merchandise included with a Ticket, the length of the
            Event, and the ability to re-watch the Event. It is in the Event
            Producer’s sole discretion whether to permit Attendees to re-watch
            an Event after the original Event has taken place. Fidio is not
            liable for any issues during an Event, and only the Event Producer
            may approve refunds if any issues arise. Attendees may not
            photograph, film, or otherwise record Events and may not post any
            such photographs or recordings to social media or make any such
            recording publicly available without the Event Producer’s prior
            written permission in each instance. If you violate these
            provisions, in addition to seeking monetary damages against you, we
            and/or the Event Producer may seek an injunction against you to take
            down such recordings without posting a bond.

            Users may not post affiliate links, blogger codes, auction site

            express your opinions. Personal attacks, harassment, and rude,
            insensitive, or offensive comments are prohibited whether they are
            directed at Artists, Fans, or Fidio staff. Chats are designed for
            bonding over common interests related to the Event. Comments related
            to your dissatisfaction with a purchase, assistance with an order,

            please take a screen shot and contact Customer Service. Be careful
            about sharing personal or private information through a Chat. Even
            if you’re posting through a username and not your real name, it can
            be easier than you think to find out someone’s real name and
            identity. Don’t post anything anonymously that you wouldn’t be
            comfortable sharing publicly. Respect another User’s request if the
            User prefers not to communicate with you. Do not request other Users

            reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against us (except
            for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in a federal
            or state court located within the Province of Ontario, Canada, and
            you and we each consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such
            purposes. You and we each retain the right to participate in
            class-wide settlement of claims.

            16.2. Informal Dispute Resolution. You and we each recognize and
            agree that good faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often
            result in prompt, low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcomes.
            Therefore, you and we each agree that, before either of us may
            commence an arbitration or assert a claim in small claims court, you
            and we will engage in the following informal dispute resolution
            process: The party seeking to initiate a claim in arbitration or
            small claims court (“claimant”) must give written notice to the
            other party (“respondent”). To notify us that you intend to initiate
            informal dispute resolution, you must send an email to Fidio, Inc.
            at legal@fidio.ca, providing: your full name; the email address and
            mailing address associated with your Fidio account; your counsel’s
            name and contact information, if you are represented by counsel; and
            a brief description of your claim(s) and the relief sought. To
            notify you that we intend to initiate informal dispute resolution,
            we will email you at the email address associated with your Fidio
            account and provide a brief description of our claim(s) and the
            relief sought, and our counsel’s name and contact information. You
            and we will then personally meet and confer, via teleconference or
            videoconference, in a good faith effort to informally resolve any
            claim covered by this mutual arbitration agreement. If either you or
            us is represented by counsel, that counsel may participate in the
            informal dispute resolution conference. All offers, promises,
            conduct, and statements made in the course of the informal dispute
            resolution process by any party, its agents, employees, and
            attorneys are confidential and not admissible for any purpose in any
            subsequent proceeding, provided that evidence that is otherwise
            admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or
            non-discoverable as a result of its use in the informal dispute
            resolution process. The informal dispute resolution conference shall
            occur within sixty (60) days of receipt of the written notice
            described above unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by you
            and us. If, after participating in that conference, you and we have
            been unable to resolve the dispute, the claimant may commence an
            arbitration or assert a claim in small claims court in accordance
            with this arbitration agreement. Any statute of limitations will be
            tolled while you and we engage in the informal dispute resolution
            process described in this section.

          <p style={paraStyle} className='text-sm font-light mt-2'>
            16.3. Governing Law; Interpretation and Enforcement. The arbitration
            agreement in the Terms is governed by the Arbitration Act (1991,
            S.O. 1991, c.17) (“AA&quot;), including its procedural provisions,
            in all respects. This means that the AA governs, among other things,
            the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement and
            all of its provisions, including, without limitation, the class
            action waiver. State arbitration laws do not govern in any respect.
            Further, you and we each agree that the Terms evidence a transaction
            involving interstate commerce and will be governed by and construed
            in accordance with federal law to the fullest extent possible.
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle} className='text-sm font-light mt-2'>
            16.4. Arbitration Generally; Relief Available. There is no judge or
            jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
            limited pursuant to the AA. However, an arbitrator can award on an
            individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including
            injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must
            follow the Terms as a court would. For the avoidance of doubt, the
            arbitrator can award public injunctive relief if authorized by law
            and warranted by the individual claim(s).
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle} className='text-sm font-light mt-2'>
            16.5. Arbitration Proceedings and Rules. The rules and procedures of
            the ADR Institute of Canada (ADRIC) shall apply to all arbitral
            proceedings.
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle} className='text-sm font-light mt-2'>
            16.7. Delegation; Interpretation. The arbitrator, and not any
            federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive
            authority to the extent permitted by law to resolve all disputes
            arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability,
            enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including, but not
            limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void
            or voidable; however, in the event of a dispute about which
            particular version of this Agreement you agreed to, a court will
            decide that specific question. This arbitration agreement is
            intended to be broadly interpreted and will survive termination of
            the Terms.
          </p>
          <p style={paraStyle} className='text-sm font-light mt-2'>
            16.8. Limited Right to Appeal. As explained above, court review of
            the arbitrator’s decision is limited pursuant to the AA; however,
            the Terms provide a limited right to appeal the arbitrator’s
            decision to a panel of arbitrators, as set forth in this
            sub-section. Specifically, in the event that the arbitrator awards
            injunctive relief against either you or us, the party against whom
            injunctive relief was awarded may – within 21 days of the
            arbitrator’s final decision – appeal that decision to JAMS, in
            accordance with the following procedure: a) Except as otherwise
            provided by the Terms, the appeal will be conducted pursuant to the
            JAMS Optional Arbitration Appeal Procedure, available at
            www.jamsadr.com. b) To commence an appeal, a party must submit the
            Demand for Arbitration Form available at www.jamsadr.com, and must
            also provide notice to the other party in the manner described above
            in this section. c) The JAMS appeal panel will consist of
            arbitrators who are either (a) retired state or federal judges or
            (b) licensed attorneys with at least 20 years of active litigation
            experience and substantial expertise in the substantive laws
            applicable to the subject matter of the dispute. d) The JAMS appeal
            panel will conduct a de novo review of the arbitrator’s decision. e)
            Except as provided in the AA, there will be no right of appeal from
            the JAMS appeal panel’s decision.
